Pet Mood Algorithm

Inputs:
- totalTasks: number (total number of tasks, completed + pending, default to 1 if 0)
- completionRatio: number (fraction of tasks completed, between 0 and 1)
- recentCompletions: number (count of tasks completed in the last 48 hours)

Steps:
1. Calculate Base Score:
   - baseScore = completionRatio * 100
   - This gives a score from 0 to 100 based on the percentage of tasks completed.

2. Calculate Recent Activity Boost:
   - recentBoost = min(recentCompletions * 10, 30)
   - Each recent completion adds 10 points, capped at 30 points total.

3. Calculate Task Volume Factor:
   - taskVolumeFactor = min(totalTasks / 10, 1)
   - Scales the mood impact based on task volume; full effect at 10+ tasks, reduced if fewer.

4. Compute Final Score:
   - finalScore = (baseScore + recentBoost) * taskVolumeFactor
   - Combines completion rate, recent activity, and task volume into a single score.

5. Determine Pet Mood:
   - if finalScore < 30: return "sad"
   - if finalScore < 60: return "concerned"
   - if finalScore < 90: return "happy"
   - else: return "joy"
   - Thresholds are dynamic and reflect the weighted score.

Output:
- mood: string ("sad", "concerned", "happy", or "joy")
- Represents the pet's mood based on task performance.
