## 🧠 Companion Mood Algorithm

Your companion's mood (whether pet, robot, or car) is calculated using three factors:
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of total tasks completed
- **Recent Activity**: Tasks completed in the last 48 hours
- **Task Volume**: Total number of tasks in the system

All companions have four mood states:
- 😢 **Sad**: Low productivity (score < 30)
- 😐 **Concerned**: Moderate productivity (score < 60)
- 😊 **Happy**: Good productivity (score < 90)
- 😁 **Joy**: Excellent productivity (score ≥ 90)

**Daily Streak:**
- Complete **3 tasks** within a single calendar day to increment your streak.
- The streak resets if you miss a day (fail to complete 3 tasks).
- Tap the 🔥 icon to view your current streak and today's progress.
